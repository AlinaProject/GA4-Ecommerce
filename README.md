# GA4 Ecommerce Analytics Platform

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow built on Google Analytics 4 ecommerce data using dbt, BigQuery, SQL, and Tableau.

The goal was to transform raw event-level GA4 data into trusted business metrics, analytical data marts, and executive dashboards while implementing data quality controls and automated testing.

The project follows a modern analytics engineering approach:

GA4 Raw Events → Staging Layer → Intermediate Layer → Business Marts → Tableau Dashboards

---

## Business Objectives

The project addresses several common ecommerce analytics challenges:

* Measure acquisition performance by marketing channel
* Track user behavior through the ecommerce funnel
* Analyze customer retention and lifetime value
* Monitor executive KPIs
* Detect and document data quality issues
* Create trusted reporting datasets for BI consumption

---

## Tech Stack

* SQL
* dbt
* Google BigQuery
* Google Analytics 4 Sample Ecommerce Dataset
* Tableau Public
* GitHub

### Staging Layer

Raw GA4 events are standardized and enriched.

Models:

* stg_ga4__events
* stg_ga4__purchases

Key transformations:

* Event normalization
* Channel grouping
* Data quality flags
* Purchase deduplication
* Transaction validation

---

### Intermediate Layer

Business logic is separated from reporting models.

Models:

* int_sessions
* int_funnel_steps
* int_user_metrics

Purpose:

* Funnel preparation
* Session reconstruction
* User-level metric calculation

---

### Business Marts

The marts layer contains business-ready metrics designed for reporting and decision making.

#### mart_executive_kpi

Executive-level daily performance metrics:

* Revenue
* Sessions
* Users
* Purchases
* Conversion Rate
* Average Order Value

#### mart_product_performance

Product performance metrics based on deduplicated transactions:

* product revenue
* quantity sold
* average item price
* transaction metrics

#### mart_funnel

Normalized ecommerce funnel:

* View Item
* Add To Cart
* Begin Checkout
* Purchase

#### mart_retention

Customer retention metrics:

* Cohort analysis
* Day 1 retention
* Day 7 retention
* Day 30 retention

#### mart_user_ltv

User-level lifetime value dataset:

* Revenue per user
* Session frequency
* Lifetime duration
* Purchase behavior

#### mart_data_quality

Centralized data quality monitoring:

* Missing transaction IDs
* Duplicate transaction IDs
* Revenue validation
* Session anomalies
* Data freshness checks

## Documentation

The project includes dbt documentation generated from model and column metadata.

Documentation covers:

model descriptions
key business metrics
column definitions
data quality tests
lineage graph showing dependencies between models

Example documentation includes:

The lineage graph provides a visual representation of how raw GA4 events are transformed into analytical datasets and business-ready marts.

## Data Quality Findings

Several issues were identified during exploratory analysis and addressed within the pipeline.

### Duplicate Purchase Events

Purchase events contained duplicated transaction IDs.

Findings:

* 4,786 purchase events
* 4,451 unique transactions
* 335 duplicated purchase events
* Duplicate rate: 7.0%

Solution:

Purchase events are deduplicated using:

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
PARTITION BY transaction_id
ORDER BY event_timestamp
)

Only the first occurrence of each transaction is retained.

---

### Missing Transaction IDs

Some purchase events were missing transaction identifiers.

Findings:

* 906 purchase events without valid transaction IDs

Impact:

These events are excluded from revenue calculations to avoid metric inflation.

---

### Funnel Anomalies

Sessions were detected where users reached checkout without a preceding add_to_cart event.

Impact:

Traditional funnel calculations produced conversion rates above 100%.

Solution:

A normalized sequential funnel was implemented to ensure valid step progression.

---

## Testing

The project includes both schema tests and custom SQL tests.

Examples:

* Not Null Tests
* Unique Session ID Tests
* Funnel Validation Tests
* Revenue Validation Tests
* Retention Validation Tests
* LTV Validation Tests

All business marts are validated through automated dbt testing.
